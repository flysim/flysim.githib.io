## Concept

Flight simulators are often proprietary - but not always (thank you Flight Gear ) - and always ponderous programs that you have to download and install.

Wouldn't it be nice for you to be able to create, edit and share flight simulators that are quite easy to code, easy to host and work in your browser

The project will take time to create. In the meantime we will build applets that are stepping stones toward the larger goals.

### flySim Globe

* Display the Earth as a Globe
	* offer a variety of terrain and overlay options
* Enables you to see quickly who flew when and where on what
	* Helps you identify popular and new destinations


### flySim unFlatland

* Planar maps with 3D terrain
* Display the vicinity of selectd airports
* Includes ILS, STAR and waypoints data
* Historical data
* Real-time data

### Standard Options

* At least three versions -possibly more
	* Historical data - all flights in a day
	* Historical data - replay
	* Real-time data
* Create your own 3D terrain 
	* Any latitude and longitude
	* Select terrain to cover
* Select choice of terrain and overlays
	* Current versions having issues with terrain suppliers that do not support HTTPS. 
	* Some suppliers may have to be dropped
* Import your CSV, or KML data
	* Create, edit and share your own flight paths
* First person controls
	* Fly your own models
* Select choice of aircraft models
	* From FGx aircraft
	* Others?
* Physics
	* So you can bump into mountains
* Inflight navigation aids
	* Current versions include a ghostly heading or bearing indicator at top right of screen
	* North is toward the top of the screen
	* Roll, pitch and yaw to be added


## Mission

A place for:

* Being able to create, edit fly and replay things in 3D in your browser - all FOSS.
* Having a supportive group of peeps that produce cool updates in a timely manner
* Designing tools coded and created by the group that do things like help with housekeeping, promotion and communication. 


### Vision

* Enable you to program your own simulators
	* Any location on earth
	* Any model - from drone to deathstar
	* Any flight path
