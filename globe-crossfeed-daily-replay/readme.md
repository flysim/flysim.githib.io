## Change Log

### 2016-08-16 ~ R7

* Replay and rotate check boxes
* Placards


### 2016-08-05 ~ R6


* No more zombies just about
* Needs to indicate where callsigns are warp seppeding instead of flying
* Needs to indicate which callsugns are not currently flying
 


### 2016-08-03 ~ R5


Still takes way to long to reload or close the page. This has to do with the trails - Three.ls lines.


* Generally being less of a memory hog
* Updates on `tot_secs`
* Still working on memory issues
* Still not deleting zombie flights


### 2016-08-02 ~ R4

Back to creating objects foe each callsigns. Means fewer objects to update 60 times per second. ;-)

Will need to look at monitoring both callsigns and FIDs.
Still too many zomble trails.
And there still appear to be some memory and performance issues tat should be cleaned up prior to adding features.

* Linking meshes and trails to callsigns 
* Add more metrics
* Simplify mesh creation and trails tacking


### 2016-08-01 ~ R2/R3

* R3 adds
	* Select file memu item, uses GitHub API to obtain list of files
	* More detailed flights menu
	* Flights based on FID not call sign. Thanks Geoff
	* No longer crashes browser (Or maybe just not as quckly ;-)
	* Objects appear at correct lat/lon
	* Better object management
* BUT trails still causing big slowdown /havimg memory issues? and not working as intended
* R2 was a dud

### 2016-08-01 ~ R1

* First commit
* Add Read Me
